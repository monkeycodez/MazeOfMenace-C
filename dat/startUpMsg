	Welcome to the `r!!Maze Of Menace!!`
	`r!!Warning!!`
`gThis game is currently in  alpha, expect crashes and bugs.`

    The Kingdom of Elbereth had, since time immemoriable, a powerful magical
    artifact known as `fThe +10 Orb of Yendor`. It protected the kingdom from
    war and strife for many years.  However, one day, Xom, the trickster god,
    stole `fThe +10 Orb Of Yendor` and hid it in the `rMaze of Menace`.  The 
    King has charged `byou`, a honorable Knight of Elbereth, with retrieving
    the orb. As you prepare to enter the dark cave, the King says "It is written
    in scrolls most ancient that pressing the `gh` key will aid you in you quest.
    I know not what this `gh` key is, but maybe you will have use of this ancient
    wisdom."
